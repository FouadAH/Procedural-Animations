# Procedural-Animations
An experiment with procedural animations using Unity's animation rigging package where I created a six-limbed spider equipped with a mounted turret. The spider is capable of climbing steep surfaces while maintaining accurate leg positions and orientation, as well as a walk cycle that is faithful to real-life spider movements.
